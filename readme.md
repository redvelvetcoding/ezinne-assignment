This is a clone of the [Dev Career website](https://devcareer.io/) (Desktop site only). This was built with `CSS`and `HTML`, to measure my learning progress as a begineer in the frontend development field. Please let me know if you have suggestions on how to improve this.

You can find this website hosted on [Netlify](https://devcareerclone.netlify.app/).
